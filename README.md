# Data_Program_Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio. Included here are some of the projects that I have been working on.

The Oracle

I created this program to summarize the order composition for all orders pending fulfillment. This program takes a shopify csv export. The Oracle Example Data.csv file has had the identifying info removed. I used this to develop my skills using data in python, specifially with the pandas package 

CSV Combiner

I created this program to combine multiple .csv files into one large file. Since I published this program for use througout my company, I used this as an oportunity to practice creating a graphical user interface.

Replenishment Report

This program was created to automatically download a file from the inventory management service ShipHero's dashboard, clean the data, and send it in an email format. This file is nonfunctional without a valid username and password for ShipHero, the password for the sender email address has also been removed. This program was used to practice using the Selenium webdriver, and using smtplib as a gmail driver.
